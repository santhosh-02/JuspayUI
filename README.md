Assignment
Project Name: JuspayUI
Description
This is a React-based web application featuring a dynamic, interactive UI. The project includes components like a header with dark/light mode toggles, routing to different pages like "OrderPage", and styled buttons. The app utilizes react-router-dom for navigation, styled-components for CSS styling, and Material-UI icons for UI elements.

Features
Dark/Light mode toggle
Navigation to various pages like the Order Page
Stylish, custom-styled buttons and components
Breadcrumbs for navigation
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
react-router-dom: A library to handle navigation and routing.
styled-components: CSS-in-JS solution for writing styled components.

Design Decisions:
Responsive Layout
Theming
Component-Based Architecture
Dynamic Styling

Challenges Faced:
Responsiveness Issues:

Initially, managing the sidebar behavior for mobile and desktop views was challenging, especially with the requirement to keep the desktop view unchanged while adding collapsible functionality for smaller screens.
Solution: Leveraged Material-UI's useMediaQuery to handle screen-specific logic and conditional rendering.
If time and design structure is given for mobile responsive ,it would be easy .

Cross-Browser Consistency
State Management for Sidebar Collapse
Dark Mode Styling:

Improvements Made:
Performance Optimizations
Improved User Experience
Code Refactoring
Better Accessibility
Scalability


Summary
This README provides all necessary details for developers to understand, install, and contribute to your React project. If you need to add any extra steps for setting up additional services (like APIs or state management libraries), feel free to extend this file.
